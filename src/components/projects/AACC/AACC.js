                <p>Every year, the Asian American Center’s student leadership team (Team 442) organizes a
                     community conference open to Northeastern students. The conference—consisting of a 
                     keynote speaker, student-led workshops, and professionally-led workshops—provides an 
                     opportunity for students to learn about and discuss issues revolving around the Asian 
                     American community.</p>
                <p>As part of the AACC’s marketing committee, I created the branding
                    and marketing materials for publicizing the 2020 conference. I designed templates for 
                    workshop facilitator bios and workshop summaries to post on the conference’s Facebook 
                    event page, as well as the Facebook event banner and pamphlet to be handed out day-of.</p> 
                <p>"Breaking Barriers" was the theme for AACC 2020, with a goal of “empower[ing] students 
                    to strive beyond stereotypes and misconceptions and embrace their Asian American identities 
                    in new ways.” To convey this theme, I researched marketing materials for other 
                    conferences/media with similar themes.</p>
